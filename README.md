# Project Name: Tailors Online

## Introduction

Hello, I'm Lucky Samuel. Welcome to Tailors Online â€“ a solo project that bridges the gap between the fashion industry and the tech world. This platform connects users with talented tailors, providing a seamless experience in finding the right designer for your fabrics. The project was born out of a passion for tailoring and a desire to address the challenges faced by both users and skilled tailors. For more details, you can explore the deployed project [here](https://tailorsonline.tech).
